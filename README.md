# Algorithm-Visualizer

This is an interactive Algorithm Visualizer that demonstrates various sorting algorithms with visual and audio feedback. It includes Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. Each sorting algorithm is paired with sound effects to enhance the user experience and make learning sorting algorithms more engaging.

Features
Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort: Simple yet effective for small datasets.
Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one element at a time.
Quick Sort: An efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
Merge Sort: A stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works well on large datasets.
Visualization: Each sorting step is visualized by dynamically updating the array bars to show the sorting process in real-time.

Sound Effects: Sound effects play with each comparison or swap operation to provide additional feedback.

Demo
The visualizer animates the sorting process and is ideal for learning and understanding sorting algorithms.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash

Install dependencies (if using a JavaScript/HTML5-based framework):

Usage
Choose a Sorting Algorithm: Select from Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, or Merge Sort.

Adjust Size: Use the provided controls to adjust the number of elements in the array.

Sound Effects: plays automatically when sorting begins.

Start Visualization: Click on the sorting names to visualize the sorting process.
